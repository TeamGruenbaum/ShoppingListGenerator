## Introduction
**ShoppingListGenerator** helps you generate your individual shopping list that is sorted by stores and shelfes.
It was created in order to make shopping fast and easy and prevents users from wandering around the stores searching for ingredients.

All you have to do is save your favorite dishes and some ingredients in the application.
When you want to generate your shopping list, you simply select the dishes for which you want to buy ingredients and additional ingredients if you like.
After your selection **ShoppingListGenerator** creates a sorted shopping list for you.
In the current version you can either save the list as a text file or copy it to your clipboard and paste it wherever you like.
