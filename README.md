## Introduction
**ShoppingListGenerator** helps you generate your individual shopping list that is sorted by stores and shelfes fast and easy. Therefore, you don't have to write it over and over again and also don't have to wander around the stores searching for ingredients.

All you have to do is save your favorite dishes and some ingredients in the application.
Now when you want to generate your shopping list, you simply select the dishes for which you want to buy ingredients and additional ingredients if you like.
After your selection **ShoppingListGenerator** creates a shopping list sorted by stores and shelfes for you.
In the current version you can either save the list as a text file or copy it to your clipboard and paste it wherever you like.

It is written in Java 11 with the Java Swing framework.
